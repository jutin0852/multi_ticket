# 🎟️ Multi-Framework Ticket Web App

This repository contains three separate implementations of a **Ticket Management Web Application** — each built with a different frontend framework:

1. [React Version](./react-app/README.md)
2. [Vue.js Version](./vue-app/README.md)

All implementations share the **same layout, structure, and design**, ensuring a consistent user experience across frameworks.

## 🚀 Overview

### 🎯 Objective
Build a **robust, responsive, and secure Ticket Management System** that allows users to:
- Register / Login (Authentication)
- View Dashboard (Statistics)
- Manage Tickets (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

Each version enforces:
- Local authentication simulation (`localStorage` session)
- Protected routes (`ticketapp_session`)
- Real-time form validation and feedback
- Consistent UI design (max-width: 1440px, centered layout, wavy hero background, responsive)

## 🧭 Folder Structure

---

## 📚 Framework Docs
- [React README](./react-app/README.md)
- [Vue README](./vue-app/README.md)
- [Twig README](./twig-app/README.md)

Each README includes:
- Frameworks and libraries used
- Setup and usage instructions
- Authentication behavior
- Component structure
- Notes on accessibility and known issues

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
All three implementations:
- Follow identical layout and styling guidelines
- Implement full CRUD with validation
- Enforce authentication and session persistence
- Maintain responsive and accessible design
